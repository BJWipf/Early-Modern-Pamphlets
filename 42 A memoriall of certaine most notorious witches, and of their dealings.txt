A memoriall of certaine most notorious witches, and of their dealings
THere dwelled not so long since, but shat of some it may be remembred. In Barking in Essex seuen miles distraunt from London a Witch named mother white-coate alias mother Aruold alias mother Glassenbury who committed many execrable factes, as may appeare.

There was dwelling in Barking one Thomas Clark a fisher who hauing angred this witch, went foorth in mackerel

time to catch flounders, and he and two boyes sayling downe almost as farre as Lee where they cast out his nets, in the same place was such an neddy that he could by no meanes woork, neither his nets come in order, as they should do, but vpon a sodaine this Clarke cryed out and sayd that he sawe mother Arnolde the witch walking in the water, and withall cryed the spirit entred into him and mooued him to kill him selfe so that hee tooke a hatchet, a hooke and a knife and threw them ouerbourd and after tyed he himselfe about the middle with a rope and so fell mad, so that the boyes cryed vnto other fishermen, who seeking to help him, there was a whirlepoole that had almost cast them away so that none durst come neer them, atlength a boat of Green wich perceiuing the whirle poole threw a roape vnto them and so plucked him into his boate and so brought him home to Barking where he remained mad, and lying still bound cryed out of mother Arnold, and in the end dyed thus tormented.
The said mother Arnold going in precession with other her neighbours in gangweek and William Daulbie seeing her very liuely came vnawares behinde her and strooke vp her heeles giuing her a fall, and after thrust him self into the prease of the people to the intent she might not know who did it, but she arysing came immediatly to him taking him by the hand thanked him for her fall, and sayd she would be euen with him.

They went to one Malles house a mile and a half from Barking where she complained of the young man and after some victualls giuen her by the good wise went homeward againe.

Malles wise and Daulbie going to Barking togither a good pace but could set no eye of her, till they came by Barking, where she sat a praying vnder a tree, and so passed by her, and so went home, where beeing not a quarter of an houre, but Daulbie was so miserably vexed, that he sought to kill himself, thrust his hedde into the swilling tub full of swines meat, where he had smothered him self if help had not preuented it.

Then would he haue runne into an hotte ouen to the burning fire brands with his teeth that hee burned his mouth and lippes very sore: when night came his friends had him to bed, but his vexation growing wursie and wursse and he feeling his bowels burne within him (as a pot seething on the fire) could not indure

the bed but lay for the most part all the night out of a windowe which hee so byted with his teeth that it may be perceiued still, so long as the window endureth, and in these miserable cases continued. At last helped by an other witch, was at the Asssses bound to appeare at Burnt wood where hee gaue evidence against mother Arnold in the hearing ofher owne daughter, who after came to him and saide you haue giuen shrode euidence against my mother but you will be little better for it. And the next night following, rysing to make water was stroken in the neck that hee fell sick and was faine to be brought from Burnt wood to Rainford in a Cart, and so from thence home, beeing pitiously vexed till he gaue vp the ghost.
WHen Master Clement Sisley Esquire had examined this witch and tolde her shee should goe to prsson the wiech desired that shee might not goe to prison, for the spirit would be reuenged as it hapned when hee tooke paper in his hand to make his warrant suddainly both his feete were taken from him by reason wherof, he fell on a plaine pauement of free stone in his owne house at Tastburyhall and strook out the huckle bone of his thigh out of the ioynt, so that for three weekes space he could not goe, nor stand along time after her erecution but vsed stiles for necessities sake.

But before he committed her to the Iaiole, he caused her to be searched by honest wiues who betweene her kercheif and her hat found wrapped in a linnen cloth swines dung, the herb cherwell dill, red fenell and saint Iohns woort, the right hand or forefoote of a Moulewarp, which vpon the opening so stanck that no person could abyde it.

After the finding of this shee kneeled downe vppon her knees, desiring them if she might not haue the whole, yet to let her haue some part therof, but the same by the commaundement of the Iustice was burned.

IF I should write at full the manifold mischeifes of this most detestable practicioner, they would fill a great volume, as how she lamed Newman of Stratforde a tanner, how shee stole


an handchercher from his wife and after fiue dayes keeping it sent it backe againe by one of her neighbours who deliuering it, faire, and white, to Newmans mayd, presently there fell three dropps of bloud vpon it one after another, and the mayd amazed giuing it to her mistris it became all ouer red as bloud most wonderfull.
Also how shee vexed one Harison beeing a Dutch man meeting him at Mile-end and stroke him so lame that he was faine to hire a horse, to carry him home, and bewitched him dumbe, that he could not speake: and made his horse to shake, aud dance, for the space of one whole yeare.

Also how she threatned George Male at the Grayhound at Barking that for so much as he thrust her and her daughter out of his doores and would giue them nothing, this witch threatned that shee would set a Bee in his tayle the next time. Yea and that a stinger sayd the daughter. So not long after he determining to ride, put on a new payre of hose with a double rugge in them prysed fortie shillings, the first day of his riding he was so tickled in the buttocke, that he scratched through all, both hose and lynings and such a hole in his slesh, that it was not whole a m•neth after.

Many other mischeifs might be heere numbred, but I meane not to stand long vppon these detestable actions only this to be noted, that beeing often examined, when she was to answere suddainly there rose in her throate a swelling as bigge as a mans fist, black as pitch, and then she seemed to haue the hitchcough, as though she would speake but could not, and in this case the examiners would strike her on the brest but she required them not to doe so: And when she was executed such a stincking vapour issued foorth of her mouth that the behoulders were scantlye able to endure it. All which is moste wounderfull.

I might heere noate the cruell deuises of mother Bumby the witch of Rochester: the tirannie of the witches of VVarboys. and many other, but for breuities sake I omit thē, putting them in memorie of one the moste straunge of all other, committed in March 1592. neer Harrow on the bill.

One Master Edling hauing a barne at the townes end, his seruant Richard Bucte going thether with a mastiue dogge after

him, suddainly espied an haire to fiart before him and set his dogge at her, but the mastiue refusing the chase ran round about the fellow whyning pittiefully, but the fellow left not till he saw the hare take in at one mother Atkins house, knowen to be a notorious witch.
The fellow perceiuing this, blessed him self and bad auaunt witch, which turned to his woe for a moneth after or there about he going to his masters barne againe met this mother Atkins and bad her good morrow, but the witch would not answere.

The next day hee went to the barne againe and carryed with him his dinner and going to his victualls about noone hee sawe a monsterous black cat, among the strawe shaking it, wherat Richard rising vp from whence he sat, heard avoice commaunding him to come away.

Come away thought he whether shall I come? the voice sayde againe come away and leaue thy victualls behinde thee and thy knife also: the fellow amazed went with his victualls in his hand to the barne doore and there was hoisted vppe suddainly into the ayre and carryed ouer many feilds by the way espying his masters plough plowing but not able to call to them from thence he was hoistedouer to Harrow ouer that side of the hill, whereon there is a great pond of water through which was drawne moste piteously that there he lost his hat and then was violently rapt vp the hill, and ouer the toppes of the trees by Harrow church but beeing haled further, he was taken into a place which was al fire wherin was such lamentable crying and howling as all the damned goules had beene there, such stuicks, such darknes, such noise and such heat that it made him so thristie that he knew not what to doe: where vpon he hauing but one peny in his pursse remembred it, and looked round about for an alehouse where hee might spend it. But perceiuing no such matters but hearing varietie of voices supposing some had spoken vnto him he replyed saying, heere is no woorke for me to doe, it was reanswered againe, coast away with him with this proviso, that thou bee seceret when then commest home: whereuppon Richard sayd my master will ake mee where I haue been and with that his tounge was doubled in his mouth that he could not speake, his legges burned, his armes and hands scorched, his coate pinched of his back and throne into the fire and immediatly was again coasted ouer hedges and ditches seued in myre and durt scratched with thornes and bryers and finally to beddawbed, singed and diffigued that it was moste lamentable to beholde him.
Thus being brought againe to his wouted place or dwelling he went to a ditch to drink and after to a freind of his being now absent foure dayes & as then able to speake, his master not knowing him at the first, but afterwards with much a doe his tounge being vnfoulded he tolde all the storie as you haue heard & would not be quieted till hee had drawne blood of mother Atkins since which time hee is amended.

Thús haue you heard the mostnotorious fact that euer witchcraft hatched, omitting many other, from all which our good God deliuer vs. Amen.
