AFter I was giuen to vnderstand of your safe return from Spanish soyle (moste deer and singuler good Freend) and of your happy arriuall heer into this Cittie, I vvas often in hart more desirous, then in effects any vviaesable, vvith some small toke of my good vvil to gratulate your vvelcome home, and to thentent I might not be touched vvith that odible vice of Ingratitude (a vice of all men moste to be detested) I imagined many times vvith my self vvhich vvay I might best frame myne habilitie, by vsing some parte of renuneration for your manifolde curtesies (as vve vpon my self as for my sake vpon my Freendes imployed) to auoid the same, emongst vvhich my cogitations this handful of scribled and banerpapers conteining the vvunderfull and moste strange crueltie of Elizabeth Stile alias Rockingham and her associates lately at Abingdon revvarded vvith the guerdo due for their demerits, came to my mind, vvhich after I had finished albeit at the first deeming them vnvvorthy of dedication to any: yet at the last incensed vvith the natuall instinct of your gentle disposition I vvas imboldened (the rather for that that you your self haue tasted of their cup of displeasure) to commend the same beeing the first frutes of my labour to the gathering of your loouing hands therby outvvardly to shevve vvhat the invvarde hart desireth if abilitie did not vvant, hoping that vvith the moste renovvmed Persian King Artaxerxes you vvil freendly vouchsafe thakfully to receiue this handfull of colde vvater, the entire cognisaunce of my vvilling minde, offered vnto you, desiring you as leasure may serue you thorovvly vvith your freends to peruse it, by reuoluing vvherof if you finde any delight, gently to thinke of the vvriter vvho vvisheth you encrease of health, vvelth and felicitie vntil the tie that Atrapos shall cut of the thread of this your mortall life and that after you haue passed the pace and run the race of this short voyage and iournye and of this brittle frail and vnconstant life yovv may be placed, sociated, knit and comined in that glittering light and blesfull life of that celestiall Ierusalem amongst the company of heauenly Soules and holy mindes vvhich do enioy the life that only may be called life and only Emire inuincible.


 Your assured Freend in the Lorde Richard Galis.




AS thou hast all ready moste (gentle Reader begun to satisfie thy greedye eyes with the freendly suruey of the late confession of Elizabeth Stile alias Rockingam, comprehending not a handful to the number of their deuilish pageats played. So perseuer still I beseech thee with no lesse good will to peruse this true edition for thy sake and contentatio only set foorth describing the strange, cruell and diabolicall tiranny practised through the little regarde and great necligence of Magistrates in these our dayes winking at ye faultes of the Offenders which neither regarded the pitteful plaints of the tormented, nor the continuall plagues of the Tormentor powred out day by day vpon their honest and inocent Neighboures, some bereft of life, some of their wits and some of the naturall course of their lims.
Emongst which I being one of the least that suffered moste and oftnest went to ye pot, thought it good to set foorth some parte bothe of mine owne troubles and of diuers others for thy behoof, in reuoluig wherof, if iro my hads thou expect for my philed phrase or lerned stile being but misled vp in a homely cuntrie Cabbin where the practise of the stayle and whip more riper

is then lernings lore, thou shalt greatly be deceiued. But if a plain Shepherds tale neither prophane or fained, oftner occupied in the tarbox and sheephook, Instruments more fit for me then either pen or inck may serue thy turn: receiue thy desire. Employe therfore thy paines in pervsing the same, and if any thing thou find that either presently cotenteth thy minde or that herafter prooue to thy proffit: giue thanks to them (and not to me) at whose instance I framed the same, which do on in requitall of my paines: I haue that which I doo expect. Thus farwel gentle Reader.

 The first attempt of Elizabeth Stile alias Mother Rockingam and her confederates Witches executed for their offences the twentiesix day of February last past practised against the Author.
BEING AT DIuerse and sundry times greeuouslye vexed, troubled and tormented aswell in Body as in Minde, some times in my raging fits detesting & abhorring all Company, eftsones again ernestly desiring the same, I often Imagined with my selfe what straunge disease and greef it should be that so should (beeing whole in Body and not ouercharged with sicknesse, although exempt of perfect remembrance) abate my flesh and weaken my Body, and lying in my bed forworne wt vnquiet rest, heauy wt ouer much watchig, & desirous to vaquish my pains by taking a little sleepe: suddainly about twelue a clock in the night a shodowe of a huge and mightie black Cat, appeered in my Chamber, which ye more as shee approched neer my bed side: so much the more began my here to stand vpright, my hart to faint, and my paines more and more to encrease, in so much I was constrained to call for my Fathers Maid, to vring a Candle, wherby I might more cleerly beholde mine Enemie which did so euelly intreat mee, which Maide, beeing entred into my Chamber: I willed to looke for ye Cat, but she was not to be found, neither could the light which shee brought continue burning, at which strange sight beeing amased: the Maide beeing gon to bed again,




and I left tumbling and tossing in my bed, more like to dye then any longer to liue, my sheets wringing wet with sweat caused through this suddain feare, I called at the last to my remembrance a Brother of mine named Iames Galis who about the Age off fifteene yeeres falling out with one Mother Dutton one of the hellish broode, and at that time suspected to be in that indeed which afterward shee prooued was in like sorte taken in his bed, and bereft of his wits, which vntil this day are not his owne stil crying away with the Witch away with the Witch, I forewith coniectured that the same Cat which so amazed mee, was either some Witch or of some Witches sending and that my paines before and at that instaunce sustained was by some Witch practised vpon mee. Whervpon knowing that prayer in all troubles and extremities was the cheefest string wheron each true Christian ought for to strike, I tooke my prayer booke wherin was conteined as wel holsome and godly prayers as psalmes, and with the brackish teares distilling from the fountaines of my eyes, I sometimes red therin, and sometime againe singing Psalmes to the honor and glory of God which had vouchsafed of his meere mercie and goodnes to strenghthen me in this my afflictions, vtterly from the bottome of my hart detesting and hauing in defiaunce all the crue of deuilish Enchaunters, wherof England at this day dooth abounde. Perswading my self that God beeing my helper, buckler and defence, neither any Witch nor all the Deuils in hel (were they in number as many as the sands in the Sea could haue once power to hurt mee, all this while not forgetting Iob whose faith no plague, no greef paine, nor vexation, that euer Sathan by Gods sufferaunce might ouer charge him with could not


any wise remooue, thus as I haue said, spending & contriuing weary and painful night in prayer, Aurora began to shewe her self, whose cristall cleernes as it appeered: so began my paines to surcease, & I to be exonerated of the burthen therof, which when I felt: I caused forwith the Bible to be brought mee, and incontinently I trurned to the before remembred history of that iust man Job, of whose stedfast faith and milde patience when I had read and read againe, such strength in the Lorde did so abound in mee, that after that time all the plagues, mischiefs and torments practised by the said hellish Hagges against mee could not afray mee.

Hovv the Author occasioned to vvalke to Cluevvorth met vvith Mother Dutton vvhome he (least thinking on) brought to VVindsore before the Magistrates vvhich vvithout any examination set her at libertie.
REcouered of my greefs and by Gods deuine prouidence restored by little and little to my former health, bearing yet in minde some parte of the said Mother Duttons dealing vsed vpon my said Brother Iames, and after that vpon my self, I determined hap what hap might, when conuenient leysure might serue to bring the said Mother Dutton to Windesore, before the Magistrates there, to the intent if otherwise shee could not purge herself the better of that wherwith she should be charged: shee might receiue such condign punishment as for such Offeders by the lawes of ye Realme was due and prouided. Which determination as it was then remembred: so in processe of time was it forgotten, til it fortuned that walking one day after dinner to walk to Cluewoorth about certain my affaires which I had there to doo: shee met mee ful in the face, whose suddain meeting remoouing my former intent then set in obliuio: caused mee furiously to lay holde vpon her arme, by the which without many woords giuen I brought her to the hall a prison in Windesor desiring the keeper therof surely to keep her in his custody vntil commaundement were giuen him by the




Magistrates to the contrary which hee denyed to doo without some speciall warrant from ye Maior or the Iustice for his discharge, whervpon I led her before Maister Richard Readforth at ye time Maior of Windesor desiring him as he was true Officer to God and to his Prince to giue his warrant to the Iaylor for the better saue keeping of this Witch heer brought by mee before him, who for her deuilish Sorceries and enchauntments cruelly practised vpon diuers honest men deserueth not to liue, affirming that if I could not prooue her by sufficient tryall to be a weed woorthye of plucking vp: I would receiue such punishment as might be to all (attempting the like either against man or woman) a good ensample but he being belike as a great number be now a dayes ye more pittie, and I would to God it may be amended, mistrusting her deuilish practises and fearing least some mischief might succeed his correctio either to him or his, altogither forgetting his oth and dutie towards God and his Prince, for the due punishmet of Offendors in yt case had & prouided commaūded me yt without further delay I should let her go, which foorthwith I did no lesse bewailing her libertie then lamenting the lack of better Magistrates to weed out such Malefactors.





Hovv the said Mother Dutton after her deliuery from the Authors hands by the Mayor, practised vvith her Associates his ouerthroovve.
AFter this pestilent Witch was set at libertie, shee with her Confederates perceiuing the little regard the Magistrates appointed to minister Iustice, for the punishment of vice had of the complaintes made and put vp against the and greatly encouraged therby, ceased not now to practise all kinde of meanes to vexe, trouble and molest mee which because of my stedfast faith in God they could not by the selues nor by their wicked spirits execute the same vpon mee, they stirred vp others to be their cruel ministers in the same.

 First procuring my Freends whome Nature lincked in the league of looue and Freendship vtterly to detest mee, shamefully to vse mee, and that which greeued mee moste maliciously to enuie mee, in such sorte and so long that I often times wished exchaunge of my lyfe for a moste hasty and speedy death, thus liuing there in exile where reason would I should haue been moste of all succoured, hated of all without cause, and looued of few, it chaunced that a Freend of mine Maister Robert Handley (before rehersed) who at that time for recreation sake making his aboade at a house of his in the cuntrie was likewise bewitched in his limmes so that he was not able to go, who suspecting his greefes to come by witchcraft, caused mee to be sent for partely for Freendships sake which alwayes hath been equall betwixt vs, and partely to vse that by my meanes which hee him self by reason of his greefs could not put in practise, to whome when I was come after a little talke had, he tolde me that hee douted very much least he was bewitched, wherfore (quoth hee) good R. Galis, if any spark of Freendship hath euer been kindled betwixt vs: I pray: thee to fetch mee a Witch, at whose sight, hope perswadeth mee I shall finde ease. At which woordes beeing indeed greatly mooued: inwardly (as one who looued his intire Freend)




bewailing my Freends troubles more then my owne, I wet forth with out any woord speaking, and amongst the crue of these helhounds I gat mee and within one half houre after God being my help: I brought foure before him, whose names ensue, videllicet Audrey the Mistresse, Elizabeth Stile allias Mother Rockingham, Mother Dutton and Mother Deuil, all which foure I caused to kneele downe before the said Maister Handley and one Maister Henry Bust Studient in Phisick (charging them holding a good cudgel ouer their backs) as euer they would passe thence a liue, not only to tel what the said Maister Handley ayled: but also to ease him of his greef, to whome they replied vsing many excuses, that they neither could tel him his desease much lesse to help him therof.
Then going about to knowe how they had spent their time in the seruice of God: I examined them in the Lordes prayer, the beleef and the ten Commaundements, wherin I founde them (to my great greef) as blinde as a beetle and as wise as a Calfe, then demaunding the cause of their necligence therin, they replied that since they were borne they were neuer taught them, neither could they finde any that would instruct them therin, and therfore it was to harde for them vpon so short a warning to answere vnto my obiections, which replication when I heard, sorye for their time so ill imployed: I drue my purse and gaue each of them a peny, charging them as they looued their owne soules helth: diligently to learn the least that they come to soe ill end, for (said I) it can not other, wise be but that for want of thone ye must looue the other and for the lack of the grace of God, the looue of his holy woord and commaundements: ye must needs serue the Deuil your Lord and Maister, and there withall I bad them in God his name to departe, and in short space after my Freend Maister Handley came to his olde course I mean to his former health.


Hovv the same foure VVitches after their departure from Maister Handley his house vvrought the Authors imprisonment and of his torments suffered during the time of his being in holde.




WHen these foure loouing Sisters were departed from my Freends house, being of mee no other wise intreated or vsed then you haue heard, misdeeming (and not without good cause) that I would woork their ouerthrow in time if I might be suffered, they sought by prison to a bridge my dayes, and because they themselues would be blamelesse and void of suspition, not contented with my paines passed beeing now hated, abhorred and as it were spitted at of all men, and especially of my owne Parents & naturall Bretheren and brought euen to ye very brik of desperation (had not God of his infinit mercy and goodnes with his mightie hand held me vp giuing me a great patience woorthy to suffer his crosse laid vpon me for my offences) they caused their Familiars without the which they could not doo any thing, to stirre vp and against mee to incence the Maior and Burgesses of the towne of Windesor (wherof my father whilst he liued was a cheef member) who without any offece committed, any hurt pretended, or complaint made against mee, clapped mee vp in Prison fast locked in a deep dungion, into the which I was let vp and downe with a rope laden wt as many gyues and manacles as either my legges could cary or my hands be able to beare, there to remain without baile, vntil their further pleasure were therin had, a crueltie more woorthy for a traytor or a murderer then for any true subiect to God & to his Prince. After I was thus inclosed in ye dark, depriued of all humain company, refused to haue any bed for my money, or libertie of the Prison vpon good and sufficient bond, I then began to mistrust my self, and feared the sudain losse of my life, which easely then might haue beene depriued and with some surmised tale easely aunswered to the worlde, though not hid from the face of the Lord, neuerthelesse emboldened by the mightie help of God to cast away all feare and patiently to suffer my troubles: I ceased not according to my accustomed vse and to my great comfort and consolation, to sing to the honor and prayse of God the fortie one the fortie two and the three and fortie Psalmes, begining The man is blest that carefull is the needy consider. &c. during thexecution of which crueltie: a pittieful sound of groning voice opened



the gates of mine eares, and presently my yros which before by workemas cunning were riuetted on, making a wonderfull great noyse much like to a Smyth working of his mettall, fell of of my legges, & I taken in so straunge a cace by the space of two houres, that I thought ye soule foorthwith would haue left the chariot of my mortall body. But still perseuering in my prayers, I ceassed not to call vpon the Lorde, not onely for my deliuerance: but also that it would please him to turne the hartes of them which had so vniustly vsed their correction vpon me. In the morning when it was daye, beeing not called to mine answere: I desired that I might be permitted to haue some coference with Maister Doctor Day Deane of the Castell royall of Windsore, or with Maister Doctor Wicham of the same Chappell, prebende men of great wisedome and learning, to thentet I might (with their opinions) be fully resolued of that which gnawed my conscience, which by no meanes I could obtaine, but within two dayes after called to my answere before the Maior and his brethren, and examined of my yrons falling of, I tolde them as before is declared, who hauing nought els to charge me with, gaue order for my deliuerace, vsing with such extremitie their like power vpon me more then a score of times, which here to expresse would be to long, and more tedious to the Reader, so that I was forced of my selfe to weaue the webbe of mine owne banishemet, rather desirous to liue amiddes the desertes of Lybia among the Sauadge and wilde beastes then in Windsore with my parentes and kinred.

Hovv by the helpe of Syr Henry Neuell Knight, Maister Richard VVarde Esquier, and other Gentlemen of vvorship, the author gat leaue to passe the seas into Flaunders, vvhere for a time he serued vnder Captaine Morgaine.
FInding here in natiue soyle no place of rest to shrowde my carefull head but onely an ougly dungeon without light or comfort, no refuge succour or helpe, but that which straūgers imparted vnto me, I immagined daily with my selfe what were best for me



to do to auoyde these troubles daily more & more encreasing. Sometimes musing vpon this, sometime vpon that, nowe deuising one thing, then by and by an other, the lametable estate and subuersion of the lowe countrie in Flaūders, came to my minde, whereof a whyle cosidering, I determined to addresse my selfe towardes that coast, there to spend (if not the remainder of my dayes) yet at the least some part of my youthfull yeares in the seruice of some one Gentleman or other. Nothing doubting, but that God knowing mine innocencie and the righteousnesse of my cause, would not onely prosper my attempt: but also giue me happy successe to the ende of my trauayles. Vpon the which point being fully perswaded, loth without licence. First of my deare father had and obtayned to depart (neuerthelesse his vnkinde dealinges considered) I bended my steppes to the worshipfull Sir Henry Neuell Knight, who with Maister Richard Warde Esquier, by waye of humble petition, I moued to talke with my father about the premisses, at whose importunate and earnest perswasios beeing ouercome, graunted their requestes, whereof beeing aduertised ioyfull to see my desier take his effect, what haste I made to set all thinges in order for my trauayle, let the iudge that haue tasted the like distresse. In fine armed at all assaies to counteruayle my iorney before pretended, and ready prest to set forward on my waye, a double sorrowe began to combate with in mee, and therewithall a doubtfull imagination. The one willing mee to cease trauaile and enioye the presence of my tender parentes, and louing companions no lesse carefull of my health then my selfe, the other encouraging mee to auoyde the dayly assaultes of my aduersaries by chaunging the soyle to submitte my selfe into the handes of Lady Fortune. Thus trauersing in doubtfull doubt, nowe musing on the one, then thinking on the other, and troubled beyond all measure, what were best to be doone: I pawsed me a while. At the last ouercome with desier to proceade on my iourney: I determined to put my self to ye mercy of Aeolus puffing blasts and to the merciles waues of Neptunes swelling Seaes.
The next day bidding my Freends and Cuntrie farwel, I trauiled toward London, and from thence I shipped my selfe




into Holland whether beeing safely arriued good hay so fel out on my side that before I had spent a day or two in seeking best for my aduantage, I found vnlooked for of Maister William Morgan Gentleman such gentle intertainment that I imployed all my enduour to augment my credit with him, vnder whome I spent some time on the land, some times on the seas as occasion serued as the Souldiers life desireth not rest in one place, halfe a yeeres seruice.

Hovv his Captaine leauing the Cuntrie the Author vvas pricked vvith a loouely motion to his natiue Cuntrie to make returne to his Father, vvho vpon his submission receiued him againe.
THe vprores a little before rife in Holand and in all the Cuntries there about, by valiant prowesse of martiall Knights suppressed: my Captain (leauing the Cuntrie) gaue me occasion to think of my Freendes in England in the midst of all mine Enemies not forgotten, which for to see an earnest desire kindled my brest, and vanquished with looue and dutie had towards them, I made my return again to Windesor, more to recosile my self to my deer father to whoe before my departure I gaue some occasio of displeasure, then for any affection I bare to the towne, before whose Fatherly aspect, when I was approched, my outwarde teares declaring my inward greefs: I fel prostrate on my knees and recognising my former follies, I craued meditation of forgiuenes vpon my speedy amendmet. At the which submission pardoning that which was past vpon performace of my promise moste like a loouing Father receiued me again greatly ioying my safe return. Neuerthelesse desirous not to remain with him abooue three or foure dayes: I departed and made my repaire to London, and in Tower street became Couenant with Maister Stephen Heath a Vintner, til such time as my Father oppressed with infinit paines by meanes of this damnable sect did call me home cruelties and iniuries doon and wrought against the braunch could not once stanch



their cruell myndes, thirsting after innocent bloud, without the life of my deare father, whose bitter paines diminishing his wonted stregth by litle and litle caused him to yeeld vnto the mercie of death, to the euerlasting grief of all that loued him, but especially to mee and other his poore children, left as sheepe without a guide to the mercie of the Woulf. Alasse what should I say? to render vnto him his due prayse, I want sufficiencie, and to make long discourse of his milde and meeke pacience, wherein hee continued vnto the last houre of his gasping breath, I can not for teares and grief, wherefore against my wil I am cut of from my purpose. But thus much you shall vnderstande that no perswasions could preuayle with him that hee was bewitched, such was his strong belief in God, and yet diuerse time sighingly complaining, would saye: O Lord, shall a man dye and bee not sicke? my harte is whole, and yet my inward paines consume me, and so meekely like a Lambe to the glorie of God, taking and suffering his troubles, passed the straightes of this mortall life, to lodge with Lazarus in Abrahams bosome.

Hhvve the Author after his fathers death abiding vvith his mother for her better comfort, framing him selfe to liue in the vvorld, vvas preuented by the sayd vvitches to his vtter vndooing to this daye.
MY deare father by these helhoundes and Impes of the deuell, thus bereft mee, and intiered in the ground (after whom we must all hie) I determined to the comfort of my mother, sorrowing the want of her wedded make, to abyde with her, framing my selfe like a subiect to liue, and as it became an honest man to do, so long as the time of his pilgrimage geueth him leaue to abide, I went (with that litle which God and my father had left mee for my better maintenance) to buye sheepe and other cattell, whereby by due foresight and diligent taking heede; I might make retourne of my principall with some aduantage, but according to the prouerbe, hee that reckoneth before his host must reckon twise, and so it fell to my lot. For after I had




stored my self with the said Cattaill more woorth at the time of their sale, then the mony I paid for them, they began now one then an other and in fine almoste all to dye, and the rest liuing in such a case, lest that I was constrained to take half the money they cost mee gaining by them as Dickins did by his Dishes who bying fiue for twopence solde six for a peny, my cattail thus beeing consumed, and many other attempts enterprised by mee, turned topsie turuie, mine olde accustomed and raging fits began to set foot within my minde I to imagin that Sathans whelps were now setting a broch the vessel of their despite to seeke my vtter spoyle and confusion. Wherfore I addressed my self to the woorshipfull Sir Henry Neuel Knight, who sufficently before perswaded of my troubles, and greatly with my good Lady his bedfellowe, (with whome I had often conference) pitying myne estate. I besought euen in the bowels of our Lord Iesus Christe that either my Aduersaries who hourely tormented mee might be cut of: or I my self to receiue the like punishment if good and sufficient proof were not on my side against them.

 Hovv vpon complaints made by the Author to Sir Henry Neuel they vvere comaunded to be brought before him, and not beeing able to ansvvere him in the Articles of the Christian faith, they vvere publikly set vnder the Pulpit,
VPon which complaint after Sir Henry Neuel had aduised him self, mooued with the pittefull aspect of my wildishe countenance, promise was made me that at a prefixed day he only for that purpose would come to Windesore, and vpon due examination had, seek redresse of my troubles. At which day appointed, I posted mee to the lodging of the said Sir Henry Neuel beeing in the Castel, there to renue the remembraunce of his promise, who knowing mine errand vpon my first entrance into his Chamber commaundid me foorthwith to bring them before him, at which commaundement, you may thinke I made no delay, but hasted mee about my busines, & brought



before him as many as I suspected, which were, Audrey the Mistresse, Elizabeth Stile, Mother Dutton and Mother Nelson, saying, Sir I haue executed your commaundement and brought them into your presence, which if by good and sufficient tryall, I can not prooue to be Witches: let me receiue the punishment due vnto them, at which woordes quoth Sir Henry vnto them, what say you to this? Then his Woorship further examined them in the presence of Maister Doctor Wickham Maister Wullard a Prebend of the Castel, Maister Morris, and Maister Stafferton Gentlemen, how and after what sorte they liued, whome they serued and how they had imployed their time, they aunswered, as euery one would in his own case the best, saying, yt where they had been suspected to be Witches & woorkers of mischief against their neighbours, it was contrary and that the occasion put vp against them was rather vpon malice then otherwise. Then said I vnder your Woorships correction, if they be such good liuers as they make them selues to be: I beseech you to examine them in the Articles of the Christian faith, and vpon their aunswere iudge of the rest. Then quoth Maister Wickham, can you say the Lordes prayer which hee hath taught you? No forsooth quoth one, no forsooth quoth an other and likewise the rest, vpon which replycation: Maister Wickham began with a moste godly protestatio to perswade them not only to forsake their damnable wayes afore & at that time vsed, and diligently to learne the Lordes prayer, the beleef, and the ten Commaundements, but also dayly for their better instructions to haue recourse vnto the Temple of God, to heare his deuine seruice, and for th'xecution there of (because none durst wade so farre against them as I) I was appointed ouerseer, beeing charged that on the next Sunday following they should be brought to the Church, and publikly in the presence of all men to be set vnder the Pulpit during the time of Seruice.




 Hovv the said VVitches vvere brought to the place appointed and hovv Audrey the Mistresse and Mother Nelson vvith in short time after died, vpon vvhose death the Author felt moste greeuous torments.
COnceiuig some good hope of future redresse vpon thexamination had before the said Gentlemen of woorship if otherwise they were not conuerted from their follie: I hied me home to my Chamber, where locking the doore to mee I fel flat on the ground rendring thanks vnto all mightie God for that it had pleased him of his infinit mercy to open the blinde eyes of the Magistrates at the last to looke vpon such Offenders which before thorow their necligence, nusted vp in all kinde of wickednes, ceased not day nor night to oppresse the Inocent, (my prayer ended) I went about my busines vntil the day was come wherin I should doo my dutie, at which day I armed my self in the Lord against the said Witches, whome gently intreating more to win their harts vnto ye Lord, then for any feare I had of them: I coducted them to the Church and in the place appointed I set them downe, (my self not standing far of the) where after by the Preacher they had receiued their lesson, and schooled for their lewd behauiour and idle life spent to no profit, but to inuent wickednes and mischief, they departed home. Afterwards whether it were for greef of the correctio executed, or the inward gnawing of conscience, feeling themselues by the Preacher touched at the quick, (I cannot tel) but with in short space after, Audrey the Mistresse and Mother Nelson dyed, after whose death the sisters left behinde giuen ouer to their owne lusts and suffered to wallowe in their owne wickednes, made their assembly in the pits in Maister Dodges backside, a place where all their mischief was pretended, and there in generally agreed either to bring me vnto my end, or liuing stil to feele a life a hundred times more sharpe then a present death, if otherwise the sooner I sought not meanes to dislodge my self, and desirous not to vse any delay in furthering their intents, about their accustomed



houres of meeting in the night: my bed, ordained for my quiet rest became the augmentor of my greefs, and in stead of sleep I was fed with continuall watchings, caused through the extreame torturs and greeuous paines sustained in the night. Thus hauing ouer passed many nights in paines, diuerse and sundry times the aforesaid Cat or the deuil him self in a Cats likenes: vsed to frequent and haunt my Chamber hurring and buzing about my bed, vexing and troubling mee beyond all measure, in such straunge and lamentable wise, that I was enforced with my weapon lying drawen vopon my bed to keep my self waking in prayers least beeing ouercome with sleepe: I should be strangled in my bed.





The Author being almost spent vvith grief, complaineth him the third time to Sir Henry Neuell, before vvhome hee brought the said Elizabeth Stile bound vvith a cart rope on the market daye.
COnsumed with these infinite paines both in body and purse eche night assayled with a newe grief, lothing anie longer to liue, seeing that in foure yeeres past, no reformation might bee had for all my complaintes. Leauing my careful bedde, the witnes of my griefe and of my inwarde sorrowe: I made me ready and girding my Skeane about my middle with a good cudgill in my hande, I gate me to Farneham to the house of father Roseman, whom furiously pulling out of his house by head and shoulders I charged (not vsing any daliaunce with me) to tell me my griefes. Who beeing agast at my dealinges, and fearing least that beeing not able to gouerne mee in my fury, I would strike of his head: Said, O maister you are bewitched, you are bewitched, wherefore looke to your selfe, if not: in fine you wilbe distroyed, for you haue many wicked women in Windsore, and such as doe much harme, and who practized the like on mee once, because I did displease them. Then I bad him tell mee what they were, who aunswered, that their names were Elizabeth Stile, Mother Dutton, and Mother Deuell, at which wordes leauing him (not altogether recouered of the feare hee conceiued by mee) I went to the sayde Elizabeth Stiles house, charging her to goe with mee vnto Sir Henry Neuelles, which squatting downe vppon her buttockes, shee denyed to doo. Then finding a Carte rope harde by, I bounde it about her myddle, and layde the rope on my shoulder, wherewith forceably I pulled her out of her house, drawing her a long the streate, beeing on the market daye (not one daring once to helpe mee) but a litle boye, which helde the rope by the ende) vntill I came vnto the lodging of Sir Henry Neuell, vnto whome in the presence of a companie of Gentlemen at that time talking with him, I offered vp my present, saying, behold



here rigth worshipfull, I haue brought you heer a monster, which because of her feebled lymmes, is not able to goe, I haue taken paynes to drawe. Then shee began to curse, banne and sweare, foming at the mouth like a bore, to the great astonishement of all the beholders, which amased with that horrible sight (more for feare I thinke then for any good wyll) suffered her to escape, with the which departure (as I could not chuse beeing greatly greeued) seeing that for all my complaintes made, no hope of redresse was to bee looked for at the Magistrates handes: I thought nowe to vse myne owne force vppon them. Wherefore dayly frequenting my selfe to haue once a daye my recourse by their doores, I would nowe one, then an other, so Ribrost with my cudgell (caried always about mee for the same purpose) that in the ende getting the vpper hand, I had them in such awe, that the Scholer hauing offended, feared not so much his Maisters correction as they did my presence, as afterwardes it appeared by Mother Dutton, who so soone as shee had heard of my comming that waye: would haue runne and locked her selfe into a Cheste for feare.

Hovve the Author hauing occasion to be abroade one night at the houre of their meeting, hee savve the Deuell in a Carte sitting, and hovve by the helpe of God he put him to flight, and of other strange accidentes done by him.
MY courage nowe beeing augmented by the triumphant victorie gotten ouer myne enemies, and feeling no more taste of my passed grieffes, my businesse so falling foorth, it was my chance one night about xj. of the clocke in the night to ride by the place where these Impes acustomed vse was to meete, to my house.

And in my waye as I was ryding, my horse Leeyng




of a very good stomacke, sudainly stopped flinging and lashing out behinde, snorting and taking on out of all measure, neyther proceading further nor retorning back, wherewith all beeing litle amased because it was no straunge thing vnto mee, I alighted and taking my sworde drawen in the one hand, and my buckler in the other, casting myne eye aside to see if I could perceiue anie bodie stirring, I sudainly spied a most horrible sight and oughly feende sitting in a poore mans cart, like one ryding to fetche in his haruest, with a payre of eies burning like the fiery flames, whose ougly shape when I behelde, falling on my knees in the middes of the dirt, I besought God to assist mee with his strength against this feende, and that through his mightie power I might get the victorie. Then rising, I went towardes the place where this good fellowe was watching for his praye. At whom (my faith stedfastly set in the Lord) I let flye with my sword, saying, auoide Sathan auoyde, and in the name of God I charge thee to auoide, thou hast nought to do with mee, wherefore go hunte after the Doe which hath caused thee here to sitte. At which wordes: a great light appeared round about the carte where hee sat, and therewithall an horrible sent of brymstone was dispersed abroade, but hee was no more seene afterwarde, with the which sent Maister Afton of the Scalding house coming that waye the self same present time, thought presently to haue died, had not helpe come in the meane time.
This doone, I gate mee to my horse, vpon whose back whe I was amounted: I passed to my house as quietly as might be without harme, where not forgetting the goodnesse of God towardes them that put their trust in him, I spent an howre or two in prayer. The next day beeing come, no lesse desirous to be reuenged of theim then they were to molest mee before: Hoping still to finde a meanes to cut theim off, and to weede theim cleane from the face of the earth, I practised many attemptes, and not so many as often executed to the entent I might bee brought to some further answere, for the extirpating and pulling vp the saide wicked weedes by the rootes. And because there was no Iustice that would execute his office therein by the othe derected vnto them. I determined to



prooue what I could doo my selfe, wherefore I gat me a pounde of brimstone, and melted the same and dipped therein as it melted a great drie linnen cloth, and into a houile of strawe of mother Duttons, I thrust it whereunto I put a great fier brande beeing of it selfe (the brimstone taken away) sufficient inough to haue consumed a hundreth times as much, which burned vnto ashes, yt strawe not once perished. An other time likewyse, one Richard Parker standing by, hauing bought a quarter of a pounde of gunne poulder, and as much of brimstone, I chose an arrowe from out of a sheafe, and thereunto I bounde the said poulder and brimstone with stringes, making therein a litle touchhole whereby to giue fier thereunto (whe I thought it good) and thrust the same into an other houile adioyning to her house, fully determined to bring her togither with her house by fier to playe the last act of her tragedy, vnto the which, with a matche set at the ende of a long sticke I gaue fier, which arrowe albeit, it consumed to ashes, yet neuerthelesse ye strawe still remained without any signe of hurt which straunge sight when I behelde, beeing a thing no lesse straunge to be tolde, then harde to be beleued: I sighing, sayde to my selfe. O Lord, what shall I doo vnto this wicked impe, & to the rest of her confederates, whom neither fier or sworde may deuoure, neither Gods thundering threates prouoke to repentance. To suffer them longer to experiment life in their wickednesse, and to the ouerthrowe of their neighbours, my hart refuseth. And still to contriue and spende my time about it: is to my hinderance. If I complaine mee of their detestable dooings: the magistrates seame deafe, if I (as enemies to God and their Prince) molest or vrge them: imprisonment laden with gyues falleth out to my share. If I craue helpe of the inferior sort (my correction so affrayes them) that albeit they would helpe, yet they dare not. Thus doo I see al hope of mas helpe taken from mee, and all comfort bereft mee: Wherefore I will henceforth cease and bridle my desires. And vnto thee O Lorde, which knowing the secretes of all mens hartes, canst and wilt, when thou seest the time, roote out and pull vp from thy good and chosen plantes such wicked graftes. To thee (I saie) will I remitte my cause, and seeke to lodge and settle



my selfe in some other soyle where iustice may be ministred, vice corrected, & wronges redressed. And therewithal departed to my house, from whence within fewe daies, after I had set my affaires in good order: I departed to seeke my aduentures, since which time of my departure, it hath pleaseth God at the last to strike these wicked and defestable liuers with the rod of his correction. Who with the pot of their wickednesse so long powred the water of God his vengeance vpon them that at the length they were appreheded and committed to the comon gaile there to remaine vntill by due proofe of their diabolicall liuings be tried, & after triall had, receiue the Guerdon answerable their demerites, where beeing founde giltie and conuicted of the crime obiected against them: they suffered at Abingdon the sixe and twentie daie of February last past for the same, as by the brief and summe of their cofession here ensuing, thou maist more at large perceiue.

7 Item shee also confesseth that mother Deuell was a poore woman, and vsed to go about begging of the almes of her honest neighbours, which if they did once deny her request; mischief alwayes ensued to them or to their cattel.

8 Ite she further saieth, yt as concerning their craft & wicked practises, they haue vsed it vpon diuers & sundry persons, of who one Langford a Farmer, inhabitig in Windsore by the theaes side was one, who died therby & whose maid shortly after drunk of yt same cup wherof the maister before had tasted.

9 Item one maister Richard Galis Gent, (father of the author) who in times past, & yt thrise at ye least, aswel for his wisdome as for his pollitique & good gouernment, had been Maior of windsore, was by their practise brought likewise to his end.

10 Ite one Switcher a Butcher, was serued of ye same sauce.

14 Item shee saith that on a time a Childe (beeing a mans Sonne in Windesore) hurled a stone on her house wherwith beeing mooued to anger shee tooke his pot from him, threatned to be euen with him, wherwithall the Child went home wardes, and in the way meeting his Father he tolde him what had happened. To whome his Father said: ye hast doon some vnhappinesse to her, come with mee and I will speak with her, and as they went togithers towards her house, the Childe sudainly began to cry out Oh my hand my hand, and his Father meruailing what hee ailed looking vpon his hand and beholding it turned clean out of course and that otherwise then Nature had framed it: tooke it in his hand and assayed to haue turned it right again, but hee & an other man a neighbour of his (beeing with him at that present) could not doo it, the which was holpen afterwardes by Mother Dutton,

15. Item she saith that as woorking the death of th'afore named Lanckforde, Maister Galis Lankfoords Maide and Suitcher the said Mother Dutton did make a picture of wax and did stick a hauthorn prick as it were against the hart of it that they died shortly after, and the said pictures they conueied in a hole made for the nonce in the Chimney coruer, before the which they set two bricks & as the wax melted so the man consumed vnto death by which meanes shee saith they could kil any of what degree soeuer.

16. Item shee also saith that the said Mother Dutton did giue a picture but whether it were of man or woma she dooth



not remember & the man that had it of her, shee thinkeh to be dead, and also yt one Gorge Whiting seruat to Mathew Pain of Caton had a picture of her self for one Foster, for that that the same Gorge and Foster fel at woords and the picture, was made in Mother Duttons house, and Mother Deuil said to her bun, spare not to plague him, thrusting a hauthorn prick against the hart of it, so yt he lay at the point of death, a long time but in the end Mother Dutton recouered him again, vsing their extremitie by kiling of a Cowe of his.
17 Item the said Elizabeth saith that the said Mother Dutton and Mother Deuil were the first Inticers of her to all those afore said dooings, and that she and euery of them did ofte times meet togither at Maister Dodges pits and soetime at the pound about eleuen a clock at night, & that Mother Dutton and Mother Deuil did alure her to doo and exercise yt craft which they them selues then and before vsed, and with them to sorsake God and all his woorks and to giue her selfe to the Deuil.

hoping for fauour, she banished him againe.
22 Item shee also saith that their woords of charme weare these, come on let vs go about it, and presently they were changed into a new shape.

 To all which aforesaid Articles the said Elizabeth saied shee would affirme, and vnto her death truely stand to.

This is not to be forgotten that the said Mother Stile albeit at the time of her apprehension and conduction to the Gaile shee was of perfect limme and ioint: yet neuerthelesse was shee after the said confession made, so altered and changed, by the inchauntments of her owne Confederates: that she was ye moste odiblest creature that euer man beheld, insomuch that shee was brought vpon a barrowe to her arrainment before the Iudges.

This is to be remembred also that amongst the Offenders afore said, and that at the time of their execution, Mother Margaret beeing vpon the ladder and readye to playe the last act, of her life, and commiting her self to the merecie of the law, by the which shee was adiudged for her desarts to suffer death: began to say the Lordes prayer in the which shee continued til shee came to these woords and forgiue vs our trespases &c. at which place making a stay crying out against one Sauoye Haruy of Windesor Ostler her accuser, which then was comming towards the place of the execution where they all suffered to see her end, saying art thou come to cast mee away? and speak to the People then standing by, mark the end of him before this time tweluemoonth, and waxing ougly to the terror of the Beholders shee impatiently ended her life.

    Finis.


The Conclusion to the Reader.
THhus hast thou heard heere moste loouing Reader how much the foolish pittie and slacknes of the Magistrates of Windesore in executing their office, hath giuen occasion to these wicked Imps



the Daughters of the Deuil, to persist in their follye, thou hast heard also remembred vnto thee what drifts of deuelish deuises since the first time of mother Duttons apprehension and brought by mee before Maister Richard Redforth then Maior of Windesore, hath by them been practised to the great hurt of the Inhabitaunts, their neighbours, and to thy great admiracion, which if at that present had been as thorowely sifted out as it was but wincked at, and as to late (I may say) it hath been by some, (since those persons in the afore confession mentioned and by their enchauntments brought to their ends) not only had enioyed their liues vntil this day: but I also a moste loouing Father and they them selues an assured and stedfast rock in the time of their need, where now by their sufferance wee be depriued of bothe. But sith to call thinges long time past in obliuion to remembrance again, will but increace my greef and renue my sorowe: I therfore will with the vale of scilence couer that which my hart desired to expresse. Only I beseech the heauenly Father who is the giuer of all goodnes that this ensample past and now to all men most apparaunt, may be so printed and rooted in the harts of all Magistrates appointed for the execution of true and vpright Iustice to the maintenaune of the good and pulling down of the wicked, that from hence foorth not only all poore mens causes may be pitied, their complaints accepted, and their wrongs redressed: but also that by their carefull industry and diligence employed, all Sorcerers, Witches and Charmerers may vtterly be weeded out from the face of the earth to the commeditie of a common welth and to the honor & glory of God, to whome be all praise, laude, dominion and power for euer and euer Amen.
